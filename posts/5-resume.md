Tech enthusiast, electronic music aficionado, design-forward thinker and gaming connoisseur. Generalist with a focus in game design. I was part of the Blackstone Launchpad at Wayne State University, receiving mentorship in entrepreneurship and business management while working as an indie game developer. Software developer for 3 years, but looking to pivot into the games industry as a game design generalist. In 5-7 years, I see myself in a Senior Design position, leading a team on AAA titles.
