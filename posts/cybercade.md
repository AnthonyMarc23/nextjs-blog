Cybercade is a side project I'm working on. The idea was to create a floorplan layout and logos for an e-sports caf√©.

### Iconography

I wanted to include this project mainly for its iconography. This was my first project where I spent considerable time creating the symbols and vector models for a floorplan. Each time that something new was needed, I spent time looking at how desktop stations, chairs, tables, and other such objects looked from a top-down stand point. One of the biggest challenges was getting away from the flatness that top-down objects can sometimes end up looking like by using gradients as a form of shading. While nothing seems ground-breaking here, I was able to learn a lot about object representation, including the level of depth I really need when approaching this type of project.

I also learned a lot about vector graphics as well, including line shaping, curves, symmetry, and shading techniques.

### Layout Design

while designing these floor plans, I also picked up some skill about layout and floorplan design, considering how people moved within the flow of a space, and how to best direct people within the confines of a store front. It was an interesting thought exercise, thinking about how to keep the flow of people within certain areas, how they move throughout a space, how visible aspects from an eye-level view would influence where and how they moved, positioning objects within a space for maximum effectiveness of its purpose (Vending Machines, Front Desk, etc.), and placing ads, video screens, and other media where the most amount of eyes can see them.

There were nights where thinking about store layout could turn in to several hours of imagining walking through a floor space, how I would move around these obstacles with as little interference as possible, and creating lanes for accessibility to disabled individuals. Having been my first time, I know there's a lot more to think about with these designs, but I feel like I put myself in the shoes of those that would benefit the most from the layouts I created.

### Logo Design

I also spent some time coming up with color palettes and a logo design for a 80's retro-themed logo and overall vibe. (As you can see, I am really digging the retro vibes at the moment.) The idea was to come up with a racy, retro feel where the lettering had strong, contrasting elements for visual distinction, and the colors could easily be distinguished by color-blind individuals. Thick, gothic letters in black, with the edges highlighted really stood out to me, and I went with the feel. Several ideas were also tossed around for a distinguishing icon; an old-school game control (think an Atari joystick) with neon coloring, combining lettering to create a directional pad; neon triangles of varying colors; and a CE fashioned to appear as an "On" switch. The logo ideas are still being deliberated on, and hopefully a finalized example can be created soon.
